			<h4>Description</h4>
			<p>The protein tandem repeats are frequently not perfect, containing
				a number of mutations (substitutions, indels) accumulated during
				evolution, and some of them cannot be easily identified. To solve
				this problem, over the last few years, several algorithms and
				software have been developed (see for review, Kajava, 2011).
				Depending on the size and character of the repeats some of them are
				performing better than others, but no best approach exists to cover
				the whole range of repeats. Our plan is to select the most accurate
				and rapid among them that will be able to cover the complete
				spectrum of tandem repeats</p>
			<h4>Structure</h4>
			<p>
				This is where you must provide information about your structure.
				There are 2 possibilities for providing the structure: Entering the
				4 letter PDB ID. For example, entering simply 1BPO will execute
				program on chains A,B C for this PDB file. Protein with multiple
				chains (e.g. 9ANT), our program will choose the unique chain to find
				repeats by using CD-HIT integrated (<a
					href="http://weizhong-lab.ucsd.edu/cd-hit/">http://weizhong-lab.ucsd.edu/cd-hit/</a>)
				.
			</p>
			Upload a file in PDB format. The file must conform to the PDB
			specification.( COMMING SOON)

				<h5>1. T-REKS 3D</h5>
				<p>
					T-REKS is an algorithm for de novo detection and alignment of
					repeats in sequences based on K-means algorithm (<a
						href="http://bioinfo.montp.cnrs.fr/?r=t-reks/">http://bioinfo.montp.cnrs.fr/?r=t-reks/</a>)
					. In this novo methods, T-REKS was used in conformation alphatbets
					generated from protein 3D structure.
				</p>
				<h5>2. TRUST 3D</h5>
				<p>Both of T_REKS 3D and TRUST 3D are based on original TRUST and
					T-REKS alternatively. However, we customized these program by using
					novel substitution matrix and our own structure alphabets.</p>

				<h5>3. VECTORS</h5>

				<p>Our technique represents a-helices and b-strands, and loops as
					vectors and uses RMSD of these vectors compare pairs of vectors
					from different proteins There are 4 type of vectors: B (for
					b-strand), H ( for a-helices), N-M-L for loops.</p>

				<h5>4. VECTORS-TREKS</h5>
				<p>T-REKS was used to detect short patterns of vectors. These motif
					of vectors, and then, were superimposed together to find the
					repeats.</p>

				<h5>5. CONTACT MAP</h5>
				<p>A protein contact map represents the distance between all
					possible amino acid residue pairs of a three-dimensional protein
					structure using a binary two-dimensional matrix. We are interested
					in contact map overlap to find the repetitive because it tell us
					how the pattern of one protein is folding</p>
				<p>After obtaining the signals from contact map of one protein, we
					will try to use Fourier analysis to identify this protein repeats.</p>

				<h5>6. RAPHEAL</h5>
				<p>
					Based on RAPHEAL server, we constructed x,y,z coordinate profiles
					like Repheal method (<a href="http://protein.bio.unipd.it/raphael/">http://protein.bio.unipd.it/raphael/</a>).
					Then, these profiles were used to find repeats.
